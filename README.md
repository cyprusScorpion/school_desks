# school_desks
This is a computational program for determining the total number of desks for three new groups of students.

If schools have decided to create three new groups and equip the classrooms for them with the new desks,
they can use this compute program. Only two students may sit at any one desk.
The number of students in each of the three groups must be known.
Output the smallest amount of desks, which will need to be purchased. Each new group sits in its own classroom.

Input data format:
The program receives the input of the three non-negative integers: the number of students in each of the three classes (the numbers do not exceed 1000).
